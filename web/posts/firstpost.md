Introducing Contex.st

## An app that solves your online collection, analysis and sharing

In one simple operation Contex.st can collect a nicely-readable webpage into it's internal database and share it on Nostr. Contex.st collects the page's entire content, locally in your iOS device, making it eaily searchable, sliceable, diceable and re-share-able in smaller bits, better bits, mixed with related articles, images, media and your own thoughts.

This is social media authoring and discourse on a new level.

### Leverage the Share Button

Contex.st leverages the share button in Safari and elsewhere inside iOS apps to collect the pages, media and (eventually) files and video into an internal database.

Your images, pages, data of all kinds are stored locally on your device and synchronized via iCloud Sync to your other Apple devices.

Pick up your iPad, collect some data and later, on your phone, its all there.

#### Efficient Sharing

Contex.st is really efficient.

As you select a page or image (soon video, documents) your Contex.st database ingests the data and optionally can also immediately share the image or link to Nostr, the decentralized, permissionless internet protocol.

#### Quickly Searching Your Data

Contex.st extracts all text from images, urls and entire web pages. Everything is indexed and quickly searchable, allowing you to find materials as fast as possible.
